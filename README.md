# Movie List App
I did Florin Pop's challenge from: https://github.com/florinpop17/weekly-projects/blob/master/projects/Week%204%20-%20Movie%20App.md
The project was done based on create-react-app and i used hooks to build it.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Start client
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```
